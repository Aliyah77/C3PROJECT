## 🧠 Project Overview

The Email Header Analyzer is a Python-based CLI tool that analyzes raw email headers to determine the credibility of an email using three authentication mechanisms:

- **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework)
- **DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

This tool can help detect spoofing and phishing attempts by verifying these components and generating a credibility score.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Supports input via text file or pasted header  
- ✅ Extracts SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results  
- ✅ Color-coded console output using `colorama`  
- ✅ Calculates credibility score (out of 100)  
- ✅ Supports multiple headers in a single session  
- ✅ Saves results in a timestamped `.txt` report file
