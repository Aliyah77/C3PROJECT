## üß† Project Overview

The Email Header Analyzer is a Python-based CLI tool that analyzes raw email headers to determine the credibility of an email using three authentication mechanisms:

- **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework)
- **DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

This tool can help detect spoofing and phishing attempts by verifying these components and generating a credibility score.
